## Notes for Reviewers

Please consider the following while reviewing the project:

- Some `// TODO` and inline comments are intentionally left in the code to highlight areas I planned to refactor or enhance but couldn’t complete due to time constraints.  
- Unit tests and integration tests are implemented only partially. I’m aware that the number of test scenarios is limited — they were added mainly to demonstrate understanding of test structure and approach.
